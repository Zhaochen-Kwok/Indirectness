# Constructing an Adversarial Indirectness Dataset to Challenge Natural Language Understanding Models

This repository accompanies the master's thesis titled  
**"Constructing an Adversarial Indirectness Dataset to Challenge Natural Language Understanding Models."**  
The project focuses on building a benchmark dataset designed to evaluate how well various NLP models handle **indirect YES/NO answers** involving pragmatic phenomena such as sarcasm, conditionality, contrast, and ambiguity.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

- Construction of an adversarial indirectness dataset
- Manual annotation and categorization of indirect answers
- Classification experiments using models such as RoBERTa, Gemma-2B, and Mistral-7B
- Evaluation across four pragmatic types: *sarcastic, conditional, contrastive, ambiguous*
- Reproduction of key experimental results from the thesis
